\#ziplib (SharpZipLib, formerly NZipLib) is a **Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library** written entirely in C# for the .NET platform. It is implemented as an assembly (installable in the GAC), and thus can easily be incorporated into other projects (in any .NET language). The creator of \#ziplib put it this way: "I've ported the zip library over to C# because I needed gzip/zip compression and I didn't want to use libzip.dll or something like this. I want all in pure C\#."

## Credits
\#ziplib has intially been developed by Mike Krueger, however, much existing Java code helped a lot in speeding the creation of this library. Therefore credits fly out to other people.
